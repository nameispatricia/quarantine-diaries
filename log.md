# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 31, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Having finished all of the lessons on the Freecodecamp Responsive Web Certification I worked on my first project: The Tribute Page. I could succesfully finish it not without getting a little help from the archives of the Freecodecamp forum. 

**Thoughts:**  It felt great been able to achieve the first project, but I know I have a long way to go and lots to learn. My finished product looks very simple I focused mainly on completing all the User stories, I have to keep polishing my skills with CSS to make a page look great.
